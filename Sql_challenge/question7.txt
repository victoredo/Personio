Performance and Optimization:
Redundant DISTINCT and GROUP BY: In the us_sellers CTE, using both DISTINCT and GROUP BY is redundant. One should suffice for eliminating duplicates.

Early Filtering: The date and country conditions could be applied in the us_sellers CTE to reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed.

Column Selection: The subquery joined with the alias p selects multiple columns (CATEGORY, SUBCATEGORY, MODEL, BRAND), but only CATEGORY is actually used in the main query. 
Reducing the selected columns could improve performance, especially in columnar databases like Snowflake.


Naming Conventions:
Case Consistency: The query uses various cases for SQL keywords and table/column names. Consistent casing can improve readability.

Descriptive Aliases: Using more descriptive aliases could make the query easier to understand. For example, sls and rvne are not self-explanatory.

Readability:
Indentation and Formatting: Proper indentation would make the SQL code easier to read and maintain.

Comments: comments are included for table names, additional comments could be beneficial to describe the query's logic.

Commas: The query mixes both leading and trailing commas, which can be confusing and make the code less readable. 


proposed update to the query below

with

    select 
        id_buyer, 
        id_seller_country 
    from dwh_sls.fct_vc_sls_order_product as sales
    where id_seller_country = 223
      and date_payment >= '2021-01-01'
      and date_payment < current_date
    group by id_buyer, id_seller_country
)
select 
    product.category,
    sales.id_seller_country,
    sum(sales.price_sold) as total_sales,
    sum(sales.gmv) as total_gmv,
    count(distinct sales.id_product) as num_products
